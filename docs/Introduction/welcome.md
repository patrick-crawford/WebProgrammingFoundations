# Welcome to Web Programming Foundations

![stylized source code](/img/source-code.jpg)

Welcome to **Web Programming Foundations**. In this course, we will learn some of the foundational skills necessary to build and deploy scalable Web Applications that leverage current technologies such as **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **HTML5** / **CSS3**, **EJS** and **Postgres**. This will involve studying: foundational knowledge of JavaScript (ECMAScript 6, ie: ES6), the Node.js JavaScript Runtime, the Express.js web application framework, the HTTP Protocol, HTML5 / CSS3, Database connectivity and finally, an introduction to web security.

Before we get started, please have a look around the site and familiarize yourself with the content. If you’re looking to get started right away, the [“Hello World"](/Introduction/hello-world) is a great place to start.
